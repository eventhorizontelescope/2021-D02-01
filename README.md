**Brief Description:**

In 2017, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration succeeded in capturing the first direct image of the center of the M87 galaxy, revealing an asymmetrically bright, fuzzy ring of light surrounding a dark interior. The ring morphology and size is consistent with theoretical expectations for the light pattern around a weakly accreting supermassive black hole with mass of approxixmately 6.5 billion Solar masses. In order to  support the physical interpretation and modeling, the EHT Collaboration partnered with several international facilities in space and on the ground, to arrange an extensive, quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength (MWL) campaign. Through this repository, we release the processed data from MWL observations of M87 in easily downloadable formats, as a legacy product of the EHT 2017 campaign on M87.

Our 2017 observations capture M87 in a historically low state, both for its core as well as the nearest knot, HST-1. The core flux dominates over HST-1 in the high-energy, making it possible to combine with the more spatially precise VLBI data. In the paper associated with this data release, Algaba et al. (2021), we present the most complete simultaneous, MWL spectrum of the active nucleus to date, as well as discuss the complexity and caveats of combining data from different spatial scales into a single broadband spectrum. The MWL spectrum is provided in a machine-readable format as the CSV file "`m87_2017_mwl_spectrum.csv`". A brief description of MWL observations and data processing is given in the file "`observations_and_data_description.txt`"; for further details please refer to Algaba et al. (2021). In addition to this primary data product, we also release machine-readable versions of other tables presented in the Appendix of the paper and intermediate data products of the X-ray analysis, as listed below.

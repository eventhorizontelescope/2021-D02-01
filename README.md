**Brief Description:**

We release a multi-wavelength (MWL) data set to accompany theFirst M87
Event Horizon Telescope Results paper series (EHT Collaboration et
al. 2019a,b,c,d,e,f, 2021a,b; Algaba, et al. 2021).
In 2017, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration succeeded in
capturing the first direct image of the center of the M87 galaxy,
revealing an asymmetrically bright, fuzzy ring of light surrounding a
dark interior.
The ring morphology and size is consistent with theoretical
expectations for the light pattern around a weakly accreting
supermassive black hole of mass ~ 6.5e9 Solar Masses.
In order to support the physical interpretation and modeling, the EHT
Collaboration also partnered with several international facilities in
space and on the ground, to arrange an extensive, quasi-simultaneous
multiwavelength campaign.
This dataset is the results and analysis of this campaign, as well as
the multi-wavelength data in easily downloadable formats, as a legacy
product of the EHT 2017 campaign on M87.
Our 2017 observations capture M87 in a historically low state, both
for its core as well as the nearest knot, HST-1.
The core flux dominates over HST-1 in the high-energy, making it
possible to combine with the more spatially precise VLBI data.
We present the most complete simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectrum
of the active nucleus to date, as well as discuss the complexity and
caveats of combining data from different spatial scales into one
broadband spectrum.
In particular we present two heuristic single-zone models assuming
isotropic electron distribution function and magnetic fields to
provide insight into the basic source properties, but conclude that a
structured jet is necessary to simultaneously explain all of M87's
observational properties.
We can rule out that the simultaneous γ-ray emission is produced via
inverse Compton emission in the same region that produces the EHT
mm-band emission, and further conclude that such γ-rays can only be
produced in the inner jets (inwards of HST-1) if there are strongly
particle-dominated regions.
Direct synchrotron emission from accelerated protons and muon
secondaries cannot be excluded at this time, however.

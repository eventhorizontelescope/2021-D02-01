# DESCRIPTION: Very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray fluxes (>350 GeV) for M87 around the EHT campaign in April 2017
#  based on observations with H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS. For details of the data processing and analysis methods,
#  please see "observations_and_data_description.txt" in this data repository and the associated publication:
#  The EHT MWL Science Working Group et al. (2021; ApJL, 911, L11).
#
# COLUMNS: observatory, start time (MJD), stop time (MJD), exposure (h), start zenith angle (deg), stop zenith angle (deg),
#  detection significance (sigma), >350 GeV flux (10^-12 ph s^-1 cm^-2), upper flux uncertainty (10^-12 ph s^-1 cm^-2),
#  lower flux uncertainty (10^-12 ph s^-1 cm^-2), flux upper limit (95% significance; 10^-12 ph s^-1 cm^-2)
# 
# NOTE: Zero values for flux upper limit (column 11) mark significant detections of the source (>=2.0 sigma).

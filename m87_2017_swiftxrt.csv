# DESCRIPTION: Fluxes in the 2-10 keV band for M87 around the EHT campaign in April 2017 based on
#  observations with Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope (Swift-XRT). For details of the data
#  processing and analysis methods, please see "observations_and_data_description.txt" in this online data
#  repository and the associated publication: The EHT MWL Science Working Group et al. (2021; ApJL, 911, L11).
#
# COLUMNS: observation ID, start time (MJD), exposure (ks), total flux (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2),
#  total flux lower uncertainty (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2), total flux upper uncertainty (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2),
#  net flux (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2), net flux lower uncertainty (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2), net flux upper
#  uncertainty (10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2)
